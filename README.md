# Egg-catcher-game
### To create an egg catcher game using Python, we need to use three different loops:</br></br>
    1. One to create new eggs.</br>
    2. Another to check if the catcher has caught an egg.</br>
    3. And the third loop to move eggs and to check if the eggs touched the ground.</br></br>
    
### Python Modules used in this project are : </br></br>
    1. itertools : to change the colours of the falling eggs. https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html</br>
    2. random: to make the eggs appear at random positions.  https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_random.asp</br>
    3. Tkinter: to animate the game on the screen.   https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html</br>
