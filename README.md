# Egg-catcher-game
### To create an egg catcher game using Python, we need to use three different loops:</br></br>
    1. One to create new eggs.
    2. Another to check if the catcher has caught an egg.
    3. And the third loop to move eggs and to check if the eggs touched the ground.
    
 </br>Python Modules used in this project are : </br>
    1. [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) : To change the colours of the falling eggs. </br>
    2. [random](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_random.asp): To make the eggs appear at random positions.  </br>
    3. [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): To animate the game on the screen. </br>
